Supplemental Exercise 3
The Palindrome Detector
A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards. In this exercise, you will build an angular application consisting of two views. Routing will be necessary for this exercise. The first view is a welcome screen welcoming the user to the Palindrome Detector. It also contains an input text box for the user to type in a word, and an appropriately labeled button that will cause the text typed into the box to be passed onto the second view.
The second view will receive the word typed into the box in the first view. The second view should show the original word (labeled “Your Input”) and the reversed word (labeled “Reversed Input”). It should also check if the word is a palindrome, displaying either “This word is a palindrome” or “This word is not a palindrome”. For this scenario, it is recommended to make the original input word all lowercase before creating the reversed string. This way, capitalization will not affect your check for whether the word is a palindrome.
Notes
• Look into the string functions built into JavaScript. These will be very helpful to you.
• You must not use JQuery or direct DOM manipulation to complete this exercise.
